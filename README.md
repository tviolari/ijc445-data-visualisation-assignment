# Data Visualisation Project

Research Question:

> To what extent and for what reasons have cancellation rates
> for the five major train operators evolved between 2019 and
> 2024?

This project will focus on answering the above question using
the cancellations dataset. Using the composite visualisation
which consists of four graphs, we can see the different ways to
portray and interpret how much the train cancellations matter
and check whether there are any changes during the years
including during the COVID period.
